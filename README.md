KeePassPHP-UI
=============

A nice user interface for KeePassPHP, built with jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. Only in french for the time being though.
Any help to translate it would be welcome !

How to install it ?
-------------------

The "keepassphp" directory (see the KeePassPHP project) must be added next to the others. And voil√†.
